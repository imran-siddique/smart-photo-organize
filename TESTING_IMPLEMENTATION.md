- **Accuracy Scoring**: Compare results against expected outcomes for known scenarios
- **Statistical Analysis**: Average performance metrics across all completed tests

### 3. Test Configurations Included

#### Conservative Tests
- **Strict Hash Only** (95% threshold): Fastest, most accurate for exact duplicates
- **Size + Hash Combination** (90% threshold): Efficient balance of speed and accuracy

#### Balanced Tests
- **Moderate Multi-Method** (85% threshold): Recommended starting point
- **Comprehensive Moderate** (80% threshold): Good coverage with reasonable precision

#### Aggressive Tests
- **Loose with Visual Similarity** (70% threshold): Maximum coverage including burst photos
- **Comprehensive Loose** (65% threshold): Catches everything, requires careful review

#### Specialized Tests
- **Filename Focused** (80% threshold): For well-organized libraries
- **Speed Optimized** (90% threshold): Fast detection for regular maintenance
- **Accuracy Optimized** (88% threshold): Best balance of all methods

### 4. User Interface Features

- **Best Practices**: Pro tips for different use cases

### 5. Testing Scenarios & Validation

#### Predefined Test Scenarios (in utils/testScenarios.ts)
- **Exact Duplicates**: Same content, different filenames
- **Similar Names**: Different content, similar filenames  
- **Same Content, Different Sizes**: Compression scenarios
- **Visually Similar**: Related but different images
- **Burst Photos**: Sequential shots with high similarity
- **False Positives**: Different photos with similar characteristics
- **Different Formats**: Same image in different file formats

#### Expected Results Validation
- Accuracy scoring based on known test outcomes
- Performance benchmarking against expected duplicate counts
- Automated validation of detection method effectiveness

### 6. Integration with Main App

#### Enhanced Duplicate Review Interface
- **Test Suite Button**: Direct access to testing interface from main duplicate detection
- **Seamless Integration**: Testing results inform the main detection workflow
- **Real-time Updates**: Test results immediately available for duplicate processing

### 7. Performance Optimization Features

#### Efficiency Tracking
- Duplicates found per second calculation
- Performance comparison across different methods
- Identification of optimal settings for specific photo libraries

#### Resource Management
- Sequential test execution to prevent system overload
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Clear feedback on resource-intensive operations (visual similarity)

## Usage Recommendations

### For New Users
1. Start with "Comprehensive Moderate" test
2. Review results and adjust threshold based on false positive rate
3. Use "Speed Optimized" for regular maintenance scans

### For Power Users
1. Run full batch test suite to compare all methods
2. Analyze results to identify optimal configuration for your photo library
3. Create custom tests for specific edge cases

### For Large Libraries (10,000+ photos)
1. Test on smaller subsets first
2. Use batch processing with resource monitoring
3. Schedule comprehensive scans during low-usage periods

## Technical Implementation Details

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Users can make informed choices about duplicate detection settings
2. **Performance Optimization**: Identify the fastest methods for regular use
3. **Accuracy Validation**: Verify detection effectiveness before processing large batches
4. **Educational Tool**: Learn how different methods and thresholds affect results
5. **Quality Assurance**: Test new configurations before applying to entire photo library
6. **Troubleshooting Aid**: Diagnose why certain duplicates might be missed or why processing is slow

This comprehensive testing suite transforms duplicate detection from a "set it and forget it" process into an intelligent, optimized workflow tailored to each user's specific photo library characteristics and requirements.
