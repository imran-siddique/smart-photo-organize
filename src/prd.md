## Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture

### Core Infrastructure Layers
1. **Presentation Layer** (`/components`)
   - UI components with strict separation of concerns
   - Feature-based component organization
   - Shared UI primitives in `/components/ui`
   
2. **Application Layer** (`/features`)
   - Feature modules with co-located logic
   - Domain-specific business rules
   - Inter-feature communication patterns

3. **Domain Layer** (`/domain`)
   - Core business entities and value objects
   - Domain services and repository interfaces
   - Business rule validation

4. **Infrastructure Layer** (`/infrastructure`)
   - External service implementations
   - Storage adapters and providers
   - Third-party integrations

5. **Shared Layer** (`/shared`)
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Utilities and constants
   - Type definitions

### Deployment Strategy
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and type checking
- **Environment Management**: Development, staging, production configurations
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, bundle analysis
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking, performance metrics, user analytics
- **Security**: CSP headers, sanitization, secure authentication
